# When the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are all made of gold
# When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the worst of all and the blood run stale
# I wanna hide the truth I wanna shelter you, but with the beast inside, there's no where we can hide
# No matter what we breathe, we still are made of greed
# This is my kingdom come
# This is my kingdom come
# When you feel my heat
# Look into my eyes
# It's where my demons hide
# It's where my demons hide
